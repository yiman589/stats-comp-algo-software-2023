# Exercise 2: Coding on the edge &mdash; being responsible for your own safety in the C++ world

## Part A: Buggy inner product

Below is a (buggy) Rcpp implementation of an inner product calculation. 

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "inner_prod.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```

Ignoring the bug for the moment, run the code below and see what you get.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "inner_prod.cpp"))

vec_size <- 1023L
v <- rep(1, vec_size)
w <- rep(1, vec_size)
inner_prod(v, w)
```

Still ignoring the bug, run the code below that calculates the same inner product many times and checks whether the output remains the same.
I mean, whether there is a bug or not, an output of a deterministic calculation should surely be the same each time?
Try running the code chunk multiple times. 

```{r, error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
first_val <- inner_prod(v, w)

for (i in 1:10^6) {
  v <- rep(1, vec_size)
  w <- rep(1, vec_size)
  subseq_val <- inner_prod(v, w)
  if (!identical(first_val, subseq_val, num.eq = TRUE)) {
    print(subseq_val)
    stop("The last inner prod result disagrees with the previous ones.")
  }
}
```

**Questions:**
What behavior do you observe above? How do you explain it?
**Answer**: In the first part, we expect the result from inner_prod(v, w) to be 1023; however, the output shows 1022. In the second part, we expect the results from each output should be the same; however, the error message appears everytime we run the code, with various answers from running inner_prod(v, w). This is because C++ has the index of a vector starting at 0 instead of 1. When the index is out of bound, what happens in C++ is undefined. If we change the code inside the for loop condition to for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i), the result becomes correct. 


## Part B: Sloppy matrix-matrix multiplication

You have been told by the instructor that error-checking is particularly important in C++ and, in particular, that you should probably check for the dimension compatibility before you multiply two matrices in Rcpp(Eigen).
But it would be fair enough to wonder: is that dude really worth listening to?
I'll leave that for you to judge, but for this part of exercise let's consider what might happen if we remove such a safeguard from an Rcpp matrix-matrix multiplication.
Below is an implementation without the dimension check: 

```{r, comment='', echo=FALSE}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "gemm_eigen_unprotected.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```

Run the code below using the above "unprotected" matrix-matrix multiplication.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "gemm_eigen_unprotected.cpp"))

A <- matrix(1, nrow = 4, ncol = 1024)
B <- matrix(1, nrow = 512, ncol = 2)

dgemm_eigen(A, B)
```

**Questions:**
What do you get as an output? What if you re-run the code chunk? Explain the observed behavior.
**Answer**: I get a 4 by 2 matrix, with the first column always being all 1024s and second column being large numbers or NaNs. The second column would change as we re-run the code chunk. Since the matrices A and B have incompatible dimensions and C++ does not check for incompatibility, C++ produces undefined behavior.


## Part C: Consequence of "tresspassing"

The code below uses the `axpy_c()` function as seen in lecture.
Run it and see what happens. 
(I am not sure if the behavior is reproducible 100% of time; if you don't observe anything striking, restart the R session and run the code chunk in a fresh state.)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "axpy_c.cpp"), rebuild = TRUE)

a <- 3.14
x <- rep(1, 1e7L)
y <- rep(0.00159, 1e3L)

axpy_c(a, x, y)
```

Now try running the code below; it should execute just fine unlike the above one.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
a <- 3.14
x <- rep(1, 1e3L)
y <- rep(0.00159, 1e7L)

axpy_c(a, x, y)
```

**Questions/To-do's:**

* What happens when you run the first code chunk above and why? 
Running the same piece of code from an R console (instead of an RStudio session) should give you more information on what actually happens.
* Why does the second code chunk run fine?
* Modify `axpy_c.cpp` to make the function safer to use.   

**Answers:** When I run the first code chunk above, the R session would abort. This is because there are bugs in the cpp file: x's length is larger than y, and hence when we iterate the for loop n=length(x) times and assign a value to the original y vector which is shorter, the bug appears as the original y vector is out of bound. The second code chunk runs fine because the length of x is smaller than the length of y. So when the for loop iterates n=length(x) times, there are no worries that the index would go out of bound. 

```{r}
cat(readLines(file.path("src", "axpy_c.cpp")), sep = '\n')
```


# Exercise 3: Multiplying two matrices ain't quite what you learned in your linear algebra class

## Part A: Paying homage to your linear algebra teacher

As we all learned in our linear algebra class, the matrix product $\boldsymbol{C} = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{B}$ of $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ and $\boldsymbol{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times p}$ has its elements defined as
$$C_{ij} = \sum_{\ell = 1}^k A_{i\ell} B_{\ell j}.$$
So a conceptually natural way to implement a matrix multiplication is looping through each row of $\boldsymbol{A}$ and column of $\boldsymbol{B}$, taking inner products of the pairs of vectors:

![](figure/matrix_multi_via_row_col_dot.gif){width=30%}

Implement a matrix-matrix multiplication based on this approach as `row_col_dot_matmat` using the starter code provided in the `matmat.cpp` file.
Then check that its output agrees with the base R matrix multiplication.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
Rcpp::sourceCpp(file.path("src", "matmat.cpp"))
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
n_row_out <- 1024L
n_inner <- 2048L
n_col_out <- 512L
A <- matrix(rnorm(n_row_out * n_inner), nrow = n_row_out, ncol = n_inner)
B <- matrix(rnorm(n_inner * n_col_out), nrow = n_inner, ncol = n_col_out)
```

```{r}
# Check the output of `row_col_dot_matmat`
diff <- row_col_dot_matmat(A, B)-A%*%B
summary(as.vector(diff))
```

## Part B: Going one step beyond your linear algebra class

We now consider an alternative approach to matrix-matrix multiplications, noting that we can think of a matrix product $\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B}$ as each column of $\boldsymbol{B}$ multiplied by $\boldsymbol{A}$:
$$\boldsymbol{A} \cdot \boldsymbol{B} = \big[ \, \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{b}_1 \, | \, \ldots \, | \, \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{b}_p \, \big].$$
Recalling from lecture that "column-oriented" matrix-vector multiplication is more efficient than "row-oriented" one for R matrices, implement `col_oriented_matmat` (in `matmat.cpp`) that loops through each column of $\boldsymbol{B}$ applying the column-oriented matrix-vector multiplication.
Then compare performances of `row_col_dot_matmat` and `col_oriented_matmat` (but only after you test your column-oriented implementation).
Which one is faster and why?  
**Answer:** col_oriented_matmat is much faster than row_col_dot_matmat from benchmark: col_oriented_matmat costs 197ms and row_col_dot_matmat costs 18.6s in median. This is because R stores matrix in column-wise, it is much more efficient to extract columns instead of extracting rows. Note that col_oriented_matmat also outperforms %*%.

```{r}
# Check and benchmark
diff <- col_oriented_matmat(A, B)-A%*%B
summary(as.vector(diff))
bench::mark(row_col_dot_matmat(A, B))
bench::mark(col_oriented_matmat(A, B))
```

Also compare with performance of the matrix-matrix multiplication via `%*%` in R, which uses whatever the BLAS library your R was configured with.
(You can find out which BLAS library R is using via `sessionInfo()` or `extSoftVersion()`.) 

```{r}
bench::mark(A%*%B)
```

When benchmarking alternative implementations (or alternative algorithms, more generally), keep in mind that the relative performance depends significantly on the size of a test problem.
It is important, therefore, to benchmark your implementation/algorithm on problems of realistic size. 
See the benchmark results of linear algebra libraries from [the Eigen development team](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark) and the results under "Gcbd benchmark" in [this github repository](https://github.com/andre-wojtowicz/blas-benchmarks), for example.


## Part C: Doing it the right way

Part A & B are meant to get you some practice writing Rcpp code and to illustrate how much an algorithm's performance depends on whether or not it respects an underlying representation of data.
Neither of the approaches we've discussed, however, is the most effective way to multiply two matrices on modern hardware.

Dedicated linear algebra libraries typically deploy _blocking_, dividing the matrices $\boldsymbol{A}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}$ into sub-matrices of appropriate size and carrying out multiplications block-wise.
This approach is designed to minimize the data motion between CPU and RAM by re-using the same pieces of data as much as possible once they travel all the way from RAM to L1 cache.
In practice, we of course shouldn't try to implement, let alone optimize, an operation ourselves when there already are efficient software libraries available.
(But, if you are interested in learning more about how the optimized matrix multiplication works, Sec 1.5.4. of Golub and Van Loan (2013) is a good place to start. Also, I found nice lecture slides on this topic [here](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/lecture/18cacheX.pdf).)

### Rcpp, Eigen, and compiler options
With the interface provided by RcppEigen, the C++ linear algebra library [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) is one obvious choice for dealing with computationally intensive numerical linear algebra tasks in R.
But the optimized C++ code provided by Eigen is _only one part of the equation_:
in order to achieve the best performance, we have to provide appropriate instructions to the compilers on how to translate the C++ code into machine code specific to each hardware and operating system.
These instructions are given in terms of _compiler flags_. 
I am far from an expert on compiler flags, so the rest of discussion is accurate only to the best of my knowledge 
&mdash; let me know if you find out any part of it to be inaccurate.

Rcpp by default applies the level 2 optimization via flag `-O2` when compiling your Rcpp code.
This flag is a shorthand for turning on a collection of more specific flags and generally leads to efficient machine code without any major drawbacks.
I've been told that the more aggressive level 3 optimization via `-O3` can sometimes hurt performance or even break things.
Which specific flags `-O2` activates to some extent depends on which (version of) compiler you are using;
you can for example see a list of optimizations turned on through the `-O2` flag by the latest GCC version 
[here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).
Generally speaking, the level 2 optimization misses some of the important optimization opportunities for scientific computation, such as fused multiply-add (FMA) and AVX's 256-bit vectorized operation discussed in class.
SSE's 128-bit vectorization seems to be activated by `-O2` with Clang 12.0.0, but I am not sure how to confirm it and [their documentation is not particularly helpful](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/clang.html#cmdoption-o0).

In compiling Rcpp code, you can turn on and off these additional options by modifying the R version of a [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Makefiles) called `Makevars` and `Makevars.win` for Unix and Windows respectively. 
To specify the compiler options for a specific R package, you can place such an Makevars file under the `src/` directory.
To specify the global options that affect all Rcpp code compilations on your computer, you can edit the Makevars file at the location given by `tools::makevars_user()`, which is typically `~/.R/Makevars` in Unix.
For example, to turn on AVX and FMA, you would add a line `CXXFLAGS += -mavx -mfma` in the Makevars file; 
to turn off SSE, you woud add `CXXFLAGS += -mno-sse`.
You can read more about the role of Makevars files [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43597632/understanding-the-contents-of-the-makevars-file-in-r-macros-variables-r-ma).

**To-do's:**
Using the `dgemm_eigen()` function from lecture, compare the performances of Eigen's and your custom matrix-matrix multiplication compiled under different optimization options.
Selectively turn on and off SSE, AVX, and FMA to see how each option affects the performances. 
(SSE should be turned on by `-O2` unless explicitly turned off, but if `-mno-sse` makes no performance difference, then try `-msse` or `-msse4`.)
Finally, turn on both AVX and FMA and check the resulting performances.
Report what you find.     
  
**Answer:** (The results are compiled using JHPCE.) From the table, no matter which accelerator we turn on, dgemm always computes the fastest. If we turn on some or all of the optimization compilers, the time reduces largely for dgemm and row_col_dot_matmat; however, this is not the case for col_oriented_matmat and the original %*% function in R.

```{r}
results <- data.frame(dgemm=c("169ms","55.9ms","149ms","57.4ms","56ms"),
                      row_col_dot_matmat=c("22s","21.9s","21.5s","21.7s","21.6s"),
                      col_oriented_matmat=c("935ms","919ms","957ms","924ms","965ms"),
                      orig_func=c("709ms","704ms","698ms","699ms","707ms"))
rownames(results) <- c("none","FMA","SSE","AVX and FMA","SSE, AVX and FMA")
